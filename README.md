# CONFERENCE-ROOM-LIGHT-CONTROLLER-WITH-BIDIRECTIONAL-VISITOR-COUNTER

This Project "Conference Room Light Controller with Bidirectional Visitor Counter" is reliable to take over the task of controlling the room light as well number of person / visitor in the room very accurately. When Somebody enters in the room then the counter is incremented by one and the light will switched ON and when any person/visitor leaves the room then counter is decremented by one. The total number of persons inside the room is also displayed on the LCD. 

INTRODUCTION - The objective of this project is to make a controller based model to count number of person visiting particular room and accordingly light of the room. Here we can use sensor and we can know present number of person. In today's world, there is a continuous need for automatic appliances. With increase in standard of living, there is a sense of urgency for developing circuits that would ease the complexity of life. Also if at all one wants to know the number of people present in the room so not to have congestion, this circuit proves to be helpful. This project "conference room light controller with bidirectional visitor counter using microcontroller" is a reliable circuit that takes over the task of persons/visitor in the room very accurately. When somebody enter into the room light will be switched ON and when anyone. The light in room will be only switched OFF until all the persons in the room go out. The total number of persons inside the room is displayed on LED display. The microcontroller does the above job. It receive the signal from the above sensors the signal is operated under the microcontroller AT89S52 continuously monitor the infra-red receivers, when any object is passed through the IR rays falling on the receiver are obstructed this obstruction is sensed by microcontroller.

  This Project-Conference Room Light Controller with Bidirectional Visitor Controller is a reliable circuit for counting visitor in room very accurately. When somebody enters into the room then the counters is incremented by one and light will switch on and when any one leaves the room then counter is decremented by one. The light will be only switch off when all persons will leave the room the total number of people inside the room is also displayed on the seven segment display.
  
  
BLOCK DIAGRAM DISCRIPTION -
The basic block diagram of the bidirectional visitor counter with automatic Room light controller is shown in above figure. Mainly this block diagram consists of following essential block.

1. Power Supply

2 Entry and Exit sensor circuit

3. AT 89S52 micro-controller

4. Relay driver circuit

1]. Power Supply:

Here we used +12V and +5V de power supply. The main function of this block is to provide the required amount of voltage to essential circuits +12V is given. +12 is given to relay driver. To get the +5V de power supply we have used here IC7805, which provides the +5V de regulated power supply

2]. Enter and Exit Circuits:

This is one of the main parts of the project. The main intention of this block is to sense the person. For sensing the person and light we are using the light dependent resistor (LDR). By using this sensor and its related circuit diagram we can count the persons.

3].89S52 Microcontroller:

It is a low power, high performance CMOS 8-bit microcontroller with 8KB of flash programmable and erasable read only memory(PE ROM). The device is manufactured using Atmel's high-density non volatile memory technology and is compatible with the MSC -511TM instruction set and pin out. The on pin Flash allows the program memory to be reprogrammed in system or by a conventional

non-volatile memory programmer. By combining a versatile 8-bit CPU with Flash on monolithic chip, the Atmel AT89S52 is powerful

4]. Relay Driver Circuit:

This block has the potential to drive the various controlled devices. In these block mainly we are using the transistor and the relay one relay driver circuit we are using to control light. Output signal from AT89S52 is given to base of the transistor, which we are further energizing the particular relay. Because of this appropriate device is selected and it do its allotted function.

WORKING PRINCIPAL - this project, an automatic room light system is developed using 8051 microcontroller.   

The main component of the project is IR sensor and we have used two of them. The placement of the sensors is important as it will determine the functioning of the project.

Practically speaking, both the sensors must be placed on the either side of the

door or entrance of the room. The sensor placed on the outside of the room is

named as Sensorl and the Sensor2, which is placed inside Sensor2.

When a person tries to enter the room, Sensor1 detects the person first and then Sensor2. This action will indicate the 8051 microcontroller that the person is entering the room.

Hence, the microcontroller will turn on the light and also increments the visitor counter tol. If there are more visitors, the microcontroller will keep the light turn on and increments the visitor counters accordingly.

When a person tries to leave the room, Sensor2 detects the person first and then Sensor 1. This process will make the microcontroller to understand that the person is trying to leave the room and hence, it will decrement the count of visitors. The microcontroller will not turn off the light until the last person has left the room.

As the visitors start leaving the room, the visitor counter will decremented and when the last person leaves the room, the count will come to 0. During this point, the microcontroller understands that there is nobody in the room and turns OFF light.

APPLICATIONS - 

-Digital visitor counter can be used in various rooms like seminar hall, conference hall, where the capacity of room is limited and should not be exceed. "CONFEERENCE ROOM LIGHT CONTROLLER WITH BIDIRECTIONAL

VISITOR COUNTER" can be used in class rooms,

-Automatic room light controller project can also be used in our home because many times we come out of our bedroom or any other room and we forgot to turn off the room light.

-Bidirectional counter project can be used in cinema halls, multiplex, malls, as well as in the temples to count the number of person entering inside, so that this place should not get over crowded to avoid congestion.

ADVANTAGES - 

1] Low cost

21 Easy to use

31 Implement in single door

4] Reduce manpower

5] Economic

61 High efficiency

7] Low power consumption.

DISADVANTAGES  - 

1] It is use only when one single person cuts the rays of the sensor hence it canne be used when two person cross simultaneously.

2] When anybody is inside the room and we need to switch off the power then w

have to do manually. So in this case we fail to automatically control the light.

3] In LCD display board we can count up to a certain number of people enteri into the room, the number of body entering the room is greater than the maximu limit of the display board then we fail to count.

CONCLUSION - 

The theme of this project when merged with certain established technologies can be quite effective in number of countries like Germany, France, and Japan etc. which control the train. This project is useful in developing countries and this project has a bright future. This project helps us to control the light of a room automatically and counts the number of person/visitor entering and leaving the room. By using this circuit and proper power we can implement various applications such as fans, tube, light, etc.

FUTURE EXPANSION - 

1] By using this circuit and proper power supply we can implement various applications such as fans, tube light, etc.

2] By modifying this circuit and using two relays we can achieve a task of openingand closing the Reference
